# LinguaLab 🧠✨

**LinguaLab** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) web application that showcases core concepts of text analysis and modern NLP techniques.  
It provides a hands-on interface to explore algorithms such as Minimum Edit Distance, Similarity, N-Grams, Next Sentence Prediction, and Sentence Probability.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔤 **Minimum Edit Distance** – Calculate the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) to transform one string into another.  
- 📊 **Text Similarity** – Compare two sentences or phrases and get their similarity score.  
- 📚 **N-Gram Analysis** – Generate n-grams of any size and explore word sequence patterns.  
- 🔗 **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)** – Predict if a sentence logically follows another.  
- 🎯 **Sentence Probability** – Compute the probability of a sentence using language models.
